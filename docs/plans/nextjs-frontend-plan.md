# Next.js Frontend Plan - TG-3SIX-O (Travel Guardian 360)
## Public Transport Delay Reporting System

## Overview
A modern Next.js frontend that enables users to report public transportation delays, view real-time disruption information, and earn points for contributing to the community.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Mobile-First Design Priority
**This application MUST be designed mobile-first.** The primary use case is on-the-go travelers using mobile devices. All UI components, layouts, and features should prioritize:
- Mobile usability and touch interactions
- Performance on mobile networks and devices
- One-handed operation where possible
- Quick access to key features (report delays, view map)
- Optimized for smaller screens first, then scale up to desktop
- Mobile-optimized forms and input methods
- Location services and camera integration

Desktop views are secondary enhancements.

## Architecture
```
User → Next.js Frontend → Fastify API → C++ Routing Engine
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Code Splitting**: Use Next.js dynamic imports for map components
2. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for user uploads
3. **Caching**: React Query for aggressive caching of route data
4. **SSR/ISR**: Use Static Site Generation where possible
5. **Bundle Size**: Tree-shake unused UI components

---

## Security

- [ ] Rate limiting (client-side throttling)
- [ ] Input sanitization
- [ ] Secure file uploads
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers

---

## Accessibility

- [ ] ARIA labels
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader support
- [ ] High contrast mode
- [ ] Focus indicators

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: API mocking with MSW
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright
- **Visual Regression**: Chromatic (optional)

---

## Deployment

- **Platform**: Vercel (recommended for Next.js)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Fastify API base URL
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_TOKEN` - Mapbox access token
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_URL` - SSE endpoint

---

## Future Enhancements

- Push notifications (PWA)
- Offline support
- Multi-language support (i18n)
